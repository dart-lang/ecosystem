## What's this?

A LLM based triage automation system for the dart-lang/sdk repo. It processes
new issues filed against the repo and triages them in the same manner that a
human would. This includes:

- re-summarizing the issue for clarity
- assigning the issues to an `area-` label (first line triage)
