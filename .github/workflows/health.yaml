# A CI configuration to check PR health.

name: Health

# Callers of this workflow should use it as follows:
#
# name: Health
# on:
#   pull_request:
#     branches: [ main ]
#     types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, labeled, unlabeled]
# jobs:
#   health:
#     uses: dart-lang/ecosystem/.github/workflows/health.yaml@main

# Callers may optionally specify the version of the SDK to use when running the
# health check. This can be useful if your package has a very recent minimum SDK
# constraint. This is done via the `sdk` input parameter. Note that this
# parameter is not required; it defaults to `stable` - using the most recent
# stable release of the Dart SDK.
# 
# The checks can also be restricted to any subset of version, changelog, and license,
# if needed.
#
# jobs:
#   health:
#     uses: dart-lang/ecosystem/.github/workflows/health.yaml@main
#     with:
#       sdk: beta
#       checks: "version changelog license coverage"
