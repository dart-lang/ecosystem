# A CI configuration to auto-publish pub packages.

name: Publish

# Callers of this workflow should use it as follows:
#
# name: Publish
# on:
#   pull_request:
#     branches: [ main ]
#     types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, labeled, unlabeled]
#   push:
#     tags: [ 'v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+' ]
# jobs:
#   publish:
#     uses: dart-lang/ecosystem/.github/workflows/publish.yml@main

# Callers may optionally specify the version of the SDK to use when publishing a
# package. This can be useful if your package has a very recent minimum SDK
# constraint. This is done via the `sdk` input parameter. Note that this
# parameter is not required; it defaults to `stable` - using the most recent
# stable release of the Dart SDK. To pass this value:
#
# jobs:
#   publish:
#     uses: dart-lang/ecosystem/.github/workflows/publish.yml@main
#     with:
#       sdk: beta
